# MCP Best Practices

- **Design for Modularity:** Keep models and context loosely coupled
- **Use Clear Interfaces:** Define explicit, well-documented interfaces
- **Handle Context Changes Gracefully:** Ensure models can adapt to new or missing context
- **Test Thoroughly:** Simulate different contexts to test model robustness
- **Document Protocols:** Keep protocol definitions up to date and accessible
- **Monitor and Log:** Track context and model interactions for debugging and improvement
