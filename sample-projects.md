# MCP Sample Projects

Here are some ideas for hands-on learning with MCP:

## 1. Context-Aware Chatbot
Build a chatbot that adapts its responses based on user context (location, preferences, etc.) using MCP.

## 2. Dynamic Recommendation System
Create a recommendation engine that changes suggestions based on real-time context data.

## 3. Sensor Data Aggregator
Implement a system that collects and processes sensor data, adapting to new sensors via MCP.
