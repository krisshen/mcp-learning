# Introduction to Model Context Protocol (MCP)

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework for defining how models interact with their surrounding context. It aims to:
- Standardize model-context communication
- Enable modular and reusable model components
- Facilitate integration across different systems

## Why MCP?
- **Interoperability:** Models can work across different platforms and environments.
- **Modularity:** Components can be swapped or upgraded independently.
- **Scalability:** Easier to scale systems by decoupling models from their context.

MCP is especially useful in AI, ML, and distributed systems where context-awareness is crucial.
