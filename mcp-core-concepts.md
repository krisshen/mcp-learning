# MCP Core Concepts

## 1. Context
The environment or situation in which a model operates. Context can include data, user input, system state, or external signals.

## 2. Protocol
A set of rules and formats for exchanging information between models and their context.

## 3. Model
An algorithm or component that performs a specific function, such as prediction, classification, or transformation.

## 4. Interface
The defined methods and data structures that models use to interact with context.

## 5. Message Passing
How information is exchanged between models and context, often using standardized messages or APIs.

## 6. Adaptation
How models adjust their behavior based on context changes.
